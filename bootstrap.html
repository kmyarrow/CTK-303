          restuarnts and so many things to do! Activities like snorking, boat riding, swimming with dolphins,
          maybe meet a celebrity on the way, and lets not forgot... SHOPPING!!! Miami is definitely on the top of my NEED TO VISIT list!</p>

          <p class="card-body">Who doesnt want to go back to the native land and learn more about their
          ancestors! I actually do! Since im Nigerian, visiting there has always been a dream of mine.
        Even though the country is in shambles and could us a new government I still want to walk on the
      same land my family did and soak in all the culutre. They have many activities to do there like, shopping
    site seeing, and also night clubs. At night is when the city comes to lifee! Mostly from what I seen online
  nigeria is a pretty decent place to visit but just like every state and country it has its problems. #ENDSARS.</p>

          visit here and see what the hype is about! This is the place where all the instagrammers live
        and take their really nice pictures with nice backgorunds. Yea, this is a place i want to visit
      and finally try IN-AND-OUT burger (although I have gotten some bad reviews). I also want to do some
      site seeing and see the culutre out in the west coast. My best friend also
    lives out here and just adores it so much. Maybe ill learn to love it like her. </p>

            effective groverment its probably amazing out there. Wouldnt mind living like a Candaian for a week.

            <p class="card-body">When I land in nigeria I might go spend a day or 2 in Ghana. I dont know if
            everyone is aware of this but there is an on going battle between Nigeria and Ghana for
          who is the better country. In my defense they are both..... not so good but the note of interior
        design i think that Ghana wins that because they have so many beautiful scences and art out there that I
        want to discover and some say when God was ceating the earth on the 8th day he rested in Ghana and that is where he resides. </p>
